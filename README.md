# Cocoon Create ModelMaker 3D Resources

## Ultimaker Cura 3D

### Correct Profile

Conventional wisdom suggests to use the Wanhao i3 Duplicator Mini profile,
however, it has incorrect print space dimensions.

Use
[this profile/definition (right click/save as)](https://github.com/liamdawson/cocoon-create-model-maker-resources/raw/master/cocoon_create_modelmaker_3d.def.json)
instead, by placing it into the `resources\definitions` folder
where Ultimaker Cura 3D is installed. Then, restart Cura if it was already
open, and a new "Cocoon" category will appear in the "Add Printer" wizard.
