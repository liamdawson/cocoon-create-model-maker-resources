# Cocoon Create ModelMaker 3D Resources

## Ultimaker Cura 3D

### Correct Profile

Conventional wisdom suggests to use the Wanhao i3 Duplicator Mini profile,
however, it has incorrect print space dimensions.

Use
[this profile/definition](https://github.com/liamdawson/cocoon-create-model-maker-resources/raw/master/cocoon_create_modelmaker_3d.def.json)
instead, by placing it into the `resources\definitions` folder
where Ultimaker Cura 3D is installed.
