# Cocoon Create ModelMaker 3D Resources

## Ultimaker Cura 3D

### Correct Profile

Conventional wisdom suggests to use the Wanhao i3 Duplicator Mini profile,
however, it has incorrect print space dimensions.

Use the
[cocoon_create_modelmaker_3d.def.json](cocoon_create_modelmaker_3d.def.json)
definition instead, by placing it into the `resources\definitions` folder
where Ultimaker Cura 3D is installed.
